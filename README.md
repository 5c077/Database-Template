# About the Database Template
The collaborators behind [MuscleDB](https://github.com/flaneuse/muscleDB) have added Scott Lewis to the fold to spearhead a new branch in this project. Using the structure (skeleton) of MuscleDB, our objective is to establish a template intended to help researchers share and visualise their data on a web-based ShinyApps platform.

## Editing the Code
In order for the user interface to accurately represent the new user data, certain fields of the code will need to be edited. This can be done by simply opening the files in RStudio. The "Comments" that follow the # symbol will give detailed intructions of what to input and where to put it. These edits will be specific to the user data, which is why it is important that the user review the file and make these changes manually.
