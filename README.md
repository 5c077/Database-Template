# About the Database Template
The collaborators behind [MuscleDB](https://github.com/flaneuse/muscleDB) have added Scott Lewis to the fold to spearhead a new branch in this project. Using the structure (skeleton) of MuscleDB, our objective is to establish a template intended to help researchers share and visualise their data on a user-friendly, web-based ShinyApps platform.
## Getting Started

ExprDB was built using the  “dplyr”, “tidyr”, “DT”, “d3heatmap”, “ggvis”, “ggplot2”, “dtplyr”, “data.table”, “plotly”, and “RColorBrewer” packages. You can install them with the install.packages(" ") command. These packages along with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) will need to be installed in order for ExprDB to work properly.
