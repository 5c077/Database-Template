# About the Database Template
The collaborators behind [MuscleDB] (muscleDB/README.md) have added Scott Lewis to the fold to spearhead a new branch in this project. Using the structure (skeleton) of MuscleDB, our objective is to establish a template intended to help researchers share and visualise their data on a user-friendly, web-based ShinyApps platform.
