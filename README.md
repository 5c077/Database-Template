# MuscleDB_skeletonised
Derived from MuscleDB, a collaborative project between Laura Hughes, Karen Esser, and Michael Hughes, this database seeks to use the structure (skeleton) of MuscleDB to establish a template intended to help researchers sort and visualise their data on a user-friendly ShinyApps (HTML) platform.
